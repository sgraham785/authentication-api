Hello World example
===================

This is a simple example showing how to use the different layers of Oy:

- Oy components (located in `elements/`)
- Intermediary modules used in templating (located in `layouts/` and `modules/`)
- Templates (just one here, under `HelloWorldEmail.jsx`)
- Server response (under `server.js`)

To run:

```
npm install
npm start
```
